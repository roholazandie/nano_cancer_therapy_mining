working on cancer nano_particle assocation matrix(each cancer considered as a sample and nano particle associations as features)
#todo should be done on the transpose and other matrices too


preprocessing:

1 - log and normalize
2-  log


dimensionality reduction
1 -  dimensionality reduction using SVD(pca)
2 -  manifold learning methods:
	2-1- LLE
	2-2- Modified LLE
	2-3- MDS
	2-4- Spectral Embedding
	2-5- T-SNE (doens't make much sense because doesnt fit with pca)


clustering
 using kmeans




visualization
2d and 3d
